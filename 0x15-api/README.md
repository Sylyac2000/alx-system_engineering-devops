## Synopsis
This repository holds some python projects I worked on at ALX.

## Background Context
Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash and that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and not efficient compared to other programming languages. The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs, are pretty much regular software engineers but instead of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just Bash scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – access and modify their data. In this project, you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different data structures.

This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash scripting, so let’s build Python scripts.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What Bash scripting should not be used for
What is an API
What is a REST API
What are microservices
What is the CSV format
What is the JSON format
Pythonic Package and module name style
Pythonic Class name style
Pythonic Variable name style
Pythonic Function name style
Pythonic Constant name style
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

## Description of what each file shows:
0. Gather data from an API
1. Export to CSV
2. Export to JSON
3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries
