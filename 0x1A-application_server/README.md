## Background Context


Your web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that you installed in your first web stack project. While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project you will add this piece to your infrastructure, plug it to your Nginx and make is serve your Airbnb clone project.

Web stack debugging

## Description of what each file shows:
0. Set up development with Python
1. Set up production with Gunicorn
2. Serve a page with Nginx
3. Add a route with query parameters
4. Let's do this for your API
5. Serve your AirBnB clone
