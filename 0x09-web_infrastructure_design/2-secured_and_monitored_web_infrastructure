What is the role of the web server

Web servers are what make Web hosting possible, that is, 
the possibility of renting a space on a server to store the files of our site.

The main job of a web server is to display 
website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

Issues with this simple web infrastructure

-if component of the system fails, there is no backup that can support 
the continuity of the functionality of the system, 
bringing the whole system to a collapse by being unable to operate.

-if some structure or node in the system needs to be repaired, 
the whole system has to be shut down, while the maintenance is done.

-Overload of traffic can be a risk to the server capacity. 
This, because there is no possibility to scale the service with additional servers as backup. 
Leading to a possible breakdown of the web page and client requests, 
as traffic surpasess servers capacity
